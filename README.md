# pteroCraft

A Discord bot that bridges your Discord server with a Minecraft server hosted on Pterodactyl. Instead of relying on insecure RCON or complex server mods, pteroCraft connects directly to your Pterodactyl panel's WebSocket API to provide safe, granular control over server management.

## Why pteroCraft?

**üîí Security First**
- **Why not RCON?** RCON is inherently insecure and should never be exposed to the internet. pteroCraft uses Pterodactyl's secure WebSocket API instead.
- **Why not make friends operators?** Minecraft's operator system is all-or-nothing. pteroCraft lets you expose only the specific commands you choose.

**üéØ Better Control**
- **Discord-based permissions:** Leverage Discord's robust permission system instead of managing complex Minecraft operator levels.
- **Self-service:** Friends can manage whitelist and check server status without bothering admins.
- **Audit trail:** All commands are logged and attributable to Discord users.

**‚ö° Simple Setup**
- **Server-agnostic:** Works with any Minecraft server (Vanilla, Fabric, Forge, etc.) as long as it runs on Pterodactyl.
- **No mods required:** Unlike DiscordSRV, Fabricord, or Discord Integration Fabric, pteroCraft doesn't require specific server frameworks.
- **Lightweight:** Just a Python bot that can run alongside your existing server infrastructure.

## Core Features

- **üíª Console:** exposes minecraft console commands via slash commands in your discord bot
- **üìù Logs:** print the raw console output for debugging
- **üîê Permission-based:** Control access through Discord roles and permissions

## Requirements

-   **Pterodactyl Panel:** Account with API access and a Minecraft server
-   **Discord Bot:** Application Token with Server Members Intent enabled
-   **Python 3.8+** (if running manually)

## Quick Start

### üöÄ Deploy on Pterodactyl Panel (Recommended)

The best way to run pteroCraft is directly on your Pterodactyl panel alongside your Minecraft server:

1. **Create a new server in your Pterodactyl panel:** Admin > Servers > Create New
2. **Fill out basic fields:** Core Details, Allocation, Limits and Resources. Uncheck the "Start Server when Installed" option.
3. **Nest Configuration:** Select the Generic Nest, python generic Egg and Python 3.12 Docker Image
4. **Git Repo Address:** `https://github.com/pnivek/pteroCraft`
5. **App py file:** `bot.py`
6. **Create the server** - pteroCraft bot will auto-install itself along with dependencies
7. **Configure environment variables:** Goto the new server's Files section and create a new plain text file called ".env" and copy & paste the example configuration in the section below. Replace the example values with your own.
8. **Go back to the console tab and start the server!**

### üõ†Ô∏è Local Installation (Alternative)

If you prefer to run pteroCraft on your own machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pnivek/pteroCraft
   cd pteroCraft
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   # or
   .\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   export DISCORD_TOKEN=abc123

   # Windows (Command Prompt)
   set DISCORD_TOKEN=abc123

   # Windows (PowerShell)
   $env:DISCORD_TOKEN="abc123"
   ```

5. **Run the bot:**
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

## Configuration (`.env`)

Create a `.env` file in the same folder as the bot.py using the following variables:

```dotenv
# Discord Bot Configuration
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token     # Your Discord bot's secret token
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_discord_server_id  # ID of the Discord server where commands are registered

# Pterodactyl Panel Configuration
PTERODACTYL_URL=https://pterodactyl.panel   # Base URL of your Pterodactyl panel
PTERODACTYL_API_KEY=your_client_api_key     # Pterodactyl *Client* API Key (Account API, NOT Application API)
PTERODACTYL_SERVER_ID=your_server_short_id  # The short ID of your Minecraft server (e.g., a1b2c3d4)
```

**Important:**
*   The `PTERODACTYL_API_KEY` must be a **Client API Key** generated from your Pterodactyl account settings, **not** an Application API key. It needs permissions to access the server console/WebSocket.
*   The `PTERODACTYL_SERVER_ID` is the short identifier found in the server's URL (e.g., `https://your.pterodactyl.panel/server/a1b2c3d4`, the ID is `a1b2c3d4`).

## Supported Commands

The bot uses slash commands within your specified Discord server (`DISCORD_GUILD_ID`):

-   `/log [N]` - Shows the last *N* lines from the server console log (default: 10, max: 20).
-   `/status` - Displays the current connection status to the Pterodactyl WebSocket.
-   `/list` - Lists the players currently online on the Minecraft server.
-   `/whitelist <add|remove> <username>` - Adds or removes the specified Minecraft username from the server whitelist.

## Setting Up a Discord Bot

1.  Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2.  Create a "New Application".
3.  Go to the "Bot" tab:
    *   Click "Add Bot", confirm.
    *   **Copy the Token** and paste it into `DISCORD_TOKEN` in your `.env` file.
    *   Enable **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT** under Privileged Gateway Intents.
4.  Go to the "OAuth2" -> "General" tab:
    *   Under "Default Authorization Link", select "In-app Authorization".
    *   Select Scopes: `bot` and `applications.commands`.
    *   Select Bot Permissions: `Send Messages`, `Use Application Commands` (and any others you might need).
5.  Go to "OAuth2" -> "URL Generator":
    *   Select Scopes: `bot` and `applications.commands`.
    *   Select Bot Permissions: `Send Messages`, `Use Application Commands`.
    *   Copy the generated URL and paste it into your browser.
    *   Select your server and authorize the bot.
6.  Enable Developer Mode in Discord (User Settings -> Advanced -> Developer Mode). Right-click your server name and select "Copy Server ID". Paste this into `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` in your `.env` file.

## Getting Pterodactyl API Credentials

1.  Log in to your Pterodactyl panel.
2.  Click your account avatar/icon in the top right -> "API Credentials".
3.  Under "Client API Keys", create a new key.
    *   Give it a description (e.g., "Discord Bot").
    *   Leave "Allowed IPs" blank unless you have specific security needs.
    *   **Copy the generated API Key** and paste it into `PTERODACTYL_API_KEY` in your `.env` file. **Save this key securely, it won't be shown again.**
4.  Find your server ID: Navigate to your server's page. The URL will look like `https://your.pterodactyl.panel/server/xxxxxxxx`. The `xxxxxxxx` part is your `PTERODACTYL_SERVER_ID`.
